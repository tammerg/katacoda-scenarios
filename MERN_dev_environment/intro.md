# Welcome to Dockerize a MERN Application

In this course, we are going to harness the power of Docker and docker-compose to allow us to setup a complete MERN environment, allowing us to run a simple movie application!

Setting up development environments can be a pretty grueling task, and having your application behave exactly the same on every developers machine is a big ask. Enter Docker. We will create a full environment with which we can create full MERN applications without ever having to install the softwares directly to our machine.

By going following the steps laid out in this scenario, you'll learn how to create Docker images for the frontend and backend of a full stack application. You'll then learn to use docker-compose to run those images in unison while provisioning a database to run your app with no installs. In the end, you'll be able to start up your entire environment with a single command.

Let's get to it!
