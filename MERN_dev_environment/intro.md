# Welcome to Dockerize a MERN Application

In this course, we are going to harness the power of Docker and docker-compose to allow us to setup a complete MERN environment, allowing us to run a simple movie application!

Setting up development environments can be a pretty grueling task, and having your application behave exactly the same on every developers machine is a big ask. Enter Docker. We will create a full environment with which we can create full MERN applications without ever having to install the softwares directly to our machine.

By going through and following the steps laid out in this scenario, you'll understand how to create a MERN environment that will ensure consistent versioning across machines. A single command will run your entire application from frontend to backend.

Let's get to it!
