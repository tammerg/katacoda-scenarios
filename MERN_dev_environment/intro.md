# Welcome to Creating a MERN Dev Environment with Docker

In this course, we are going to harness the power of Docker Containers to create a complete MERN Development Environment, without installing anything to our local machine!

Setting up development environments can be a pretty grueling task, and having your application behave exactly the same on every machine is a big ask. Enter Docker. We will create a full environment with which we can create full MERN applications without ever having to install the tech directly to our machine.
